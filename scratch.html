        Kuroko's Basketball (in Japanese: Kuroko no Basket) is a Japanese sport manga serie from December 2008 to September 2014. 
        Later, it was adapted to anime television since 2012.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Kuroko's Basketball is one of my favorites animes. ❤️</strong>

    <h3>Plot:</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">
        The Teiko Middle School basketball team dominated basketball teams within 
        Japan, winning the middle school Nationals for three consecutive years. The 
        star players of the team became known as the "Generation of Miracles". After 
        graduating from middle school, the five star players went to different high 
        schools with top basketball teams. However, there was a rumor that there was 
        another player in the "Generation of Miracles": a phantom sixth man. This 
        mysterious player is now a freshman at Seirin High, a new school with a powerful,
        if little-known, team. Now, Tetsuya Kuroko–the sixth member of the "Generation 
        of Miracles", and Taiga Kagami – a naturally talented player who spent most of 
        his youth in the US, aim to bring Seirin to the top of Japan by taking on 
        Kuroko's former teammates one by one.

                <li>Do you have any favorite character?</li>

                <br>
                <li>Against who was your favorite "Generation of Miracles" game?</li>
                <p>Definitely the game of Kuroko against Aomine in the Winter Cup League, when 
                both Kagami and Amonime entered into the Zone. Very exciting episodes to watch (even got goosebumps!)</p>
                <li>Have you read the mangas?</li>
                <p>I have read some volumns but I am trying to get all the 15 mangas. I bought few on them through Amanzon
                    because from where I am, there aren't any physical mangas available. I have also read the side stories,
                    they are awesome and make you love the characters even more!</p>
                <li>Who is your absolute favorite character and why?</li>
                <p>From the three characters that I listed before, my ABSOLUTE favorite is Amine, and here 
                    are the reasons why:
                    <ol>
                        <li>His character development</li>
                        <li>His friendship with Kuroko</li>
                        <li>His passion towards basketball during Teiko</li>
                        <li>His support to his friends</li>
                        <li>HIS BLOW-MINDING TALENT IN BASKET!</li>
